When you do it twice, it’s a realignment.\nThe coalition that Barack Obama put together to win the presidency handily in 2008 looked a lot like the emerging Democratic majority that optimistic liberals had been discerning on the political horizon since the 1990s. It was the late George McGovern’s losing coalition from 1972 finally come of age: Young voters, the unmarried, African-Americans, Hispanics, the liberal professional class – and then more than enough of the party’s old blue collar base to hold the Rust Belt for the Democrats.\nBut 2008 was also a unique political moment, when George W. Bush’s immense unpopularity was compounded by a financial collapse, and when the possibility of electing the country’s first black president fired the imagination of the nation (and the nation’s press corps). So it was still possible to regard the Obama majority of ’08 as more flukish than transformative – or at the very least, to see it as a fragile thing, easily shattered by poor choices and adverse developments.\nThere were plenty of both during the president’s first term. The Obama White House underestimated the depth of the recession, it overreached politically on the health care bill and the failed push for cap and trade and it reaped a backlash at the polls in 2010. The Republican Party, left for dead after 2008, revived itself, and at many points across the 2012 campaign season Obama’s majority coalition looked vulnerable. Its policy victories seemed to teeter on the edge.\nAnd the Obama coalition was vulnerable. I believed that at the beginning of the campaign season; I believed it in mid-October, when I thought Mitt Romney might just pull the election out; and I believe it even now that the president has won a narrow (in the popular vote) but electorally decisive victory.\nBut the lesson of the election is that the Obama coalition was truly vulnerable only to a Republican Party that took Obama seriously as an opponent – that understood how his majority had been built, why voters had joined it and why the conservative majority of the Reagan and Bush eras had unraveled.\nSuch understanding eluded the Republicans this year. In part, that failure can be blamed on their standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, who mostly ran as a kind of vanilla Republican instead of showing the imagination necessary to reinvent his party for a new era. Romney’s final month of campaigning was nearly flawless, though. His debate performances were the best by any Republican since Reagan and he will go down in history as one of the few losing challengers to claim a late lead in the polls. A weak nominee in many ways, he was ultimately defeated less by his own limitations as a leader, and more by the fact that his party didn’t particularly want to be reinvented, preferring to believe that the rhetoric and positioning of 1980 and 1984 could win again in the America of 2012.\nYou could see this belief at work in the confidence with which many conservatives insisted that the Obama presidency was not only embattled but self-evidently disastrous, in the way so many voices on the right sought to raise the ideological stakes at every opportunity, in the widespread conviction that the starker conservatives made the choice between left and right, the more votes they would win.\nYou could also see this conviction shaping the punditry and predictions that issued from conservatives in the days leading up this election. It was remarkable how many analysts not normally known for their boosterism (I’m thinking of Michael Barone and George Will in particular) were willing to predict that Romney would not only win but win sweepingly, capturing states that haven’t gone Republican since Reagan. But even less starry-eyed conservatives — like, well, myself — were willing to embrace models of the electorate that overstated the Republican base of support and downplayed the Democrats’ mounting demographic advantage.\nThose models were wrong about 2012, and they aren’t likely to be right about 2016 or 2020. Republicans can console themselves that they came close in the popular vote. They can look ahead to a favorable Senate map in 2014 and they do still have their House majority to fall back on.\nBut Tuesday’s result ratifies much of the leftward shift in public policy that President Obama achieved during his first term. It paves the way for the White House to raise at least some of the tax revenue required to pay for a more activist government and it means that the Republicans let a golden chance to claim a governing coalition of their own slip away.\nIn this sense, just as Reagan Republicanism dominated the 1980s even though the Democrats controlled the House, our own era now clearly belongs to the Obama Democrats even though John Boehner is still speaker of the House.\nThat era will not last forever; it may not even last more than another four years. The current Democratic majority has its share of internal contradictions, and as it expands demographically it will become vulnerable to attack on many fronts. Parties are more adaptable than they seem in their moments of defeat, and there will come a day when a Republican presidential candidate will succeed where Mitt Romney just failed.\nBut getting there requires that conservatives face reality: The age of Reagan is officially over, and the Obama majority is the only majority we have."},"299":{"url":"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/nov-5-late-poll-gains-for-obama-leave-romney-with-longer-odds/","adx_keywords":"Obama, Barack; Romney, Mitt; Polls and Public Opinion; Presidential Election of 2012","column":"FiveThirtyEight","section":"U.S.","byline":"By NATE SILVER","type":"Blog","title":"Nov. 5: Late Poll Gains for Obama Leave Romney With Longer Odds","abstract":"President Obama appears to have gained ground in the closing days of the race: among 12 national polls published on Monday, he led Mitt Romney by an average of 1.6 percentage points.","published_date":"2012-11-06","source":"The New York Times","id":299,"asset_id":299,"views":570657,"des_facet":["POLLS AND PUBLIC OPINION","PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2012"],"org_facet":"","per_facet":["OBAMA, BARACK","ROMNEY, MITT"],"geo_facet":"","media":[{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"","copyright":"","media-metadata":[{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/06/us/politics/fivethirtyeight-1106-1/fivethirtyeight-1106-1-custom1.jpg","format":"Large","height":259,"width":351}]},{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"","copyright":"","media-metadata":[{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/06/us/politics/fivethirtyeight-1106-2/fivethirtyeight-1106-2-custom2.jpg","format":"Large","height":512,"width":380}]}],"text":"Mitt Romney has always had difficulty drawing a winning Electoral College hand. Even during his best period of polling, in the week or two after the first presidential debate in Denver, he never quite pulled ahead in the polling averages in Ohio and other states that would allow him to secure 270 electoral votes.\nBut the most recent set of polls suggest another problem for Mr. Romney, whose momentum in the polls stalled out in mid-October. Instead, it is President Obama who is making gains.\nAmong 12 national polls published on Monday, Mr. Obama led by an average of 1.6 percentage points. Perhaps more important is the trend in the surveys. On average, Mr. Obama gained 1.5 percentage points from the prior edition of the same polls, improving his standing in nine of the surveys while losing ground in just one.\nBecause these surveys had large sample sizes, the trend is both statistically and practically meaningful. Whether because of Hurricane Sandy, the relatively good economic news of late, or other factors, Mr. Obama appears to have gained ground in the closing days of the race.\n The national polls now range from showing a 1-point lead for Mr. Romney to slightly more than a 4-point advantage for Mr. Obama. The FiveThirtyEight forecast of the national popular vote is within this range, projecting Mr. Obama’s most likely margin of victory to be two or three percentage points, approximating the margin that George W. Bush achieved in defeating John Kerry in 2004.\nAveraging polls together increases their sample size — making them much more powerful statistically than any one poll taken alone. But the errors in the polls are sometimes correlated, meaning there are years when most of them miss in the same direction. Mr. Romney remains close enough to Mr. Obama that he could fairly easily win the popular vote if there is such an error in Mr. Obama’s favor this year.\nMr. Romney’s chances are less, however, of winning the Electoral College. The large majority of polls in battleground states over the past three days have shown leads for Mr. Obama. On Monday, for example, 19 battleground state polls found leads for Mr. Obama, as compared with just three for Mr. Romney.\nOhio remains the largest problem for Mr. Romney, where he has been behind in most polls all year. Mr. Romney might ordinarily take some solace in the fact that Ohio is slightly Republican-leaning, but the auto bailout may have changed its character this year, as there is evidence that Mr. Obama is performing more strongly with working-class voters in Ohio than he is elsewhere in the country.\nMr. Obama could secure the Electoral College by winning Wisconsin, Nevada and Pennsylvania, along with Ohio.\nA win for Mr. Romney in Wisconsin would now qualify as a substantial upset. He has not led in a poll there since August, and an increasing number of surveys there instead show Mr. Obama five or more points ahead.\nMr. Obama’s margins have been narrower in Nevada, but Mr. Romney has a different type of problem there: perhaps 70 percent of the state has already voted, and Democrats have locked in roughly a 7-point advantage over Republicans from the vote so far. This margin is down for Democrats from 2008, but Mr. Romney would nevertheless need an exceptional turnout on Tuesday to make up enough ground.\nThis has led Mr. Romney to make a last-minute play for Pennsylvania, and there is some evidence that the state has tightened slightly. But the gains for Mr. Romney may be too little and too late, or they may have been counteracted by a national trend toward Mr. Obama. With the exception of one Republican polling firm, public polls of the state still have Mr. Obama leading by three to nine percentage points.\nMoreover, Mr. Obama has a number of backup options were he to lose one or more of these states. In Iowa, Mr. Obama leads by about three percentage points in the average of polls, and by a similar margin in New Hampshire. Recent polls also suggest movement toward Mr. Obama in Colorado and Virginia, and he now appears to be favored in each one.\nFlorida remains too close to call. The FiveThirtyEight forecast has the race there within two-tenths of a percentage point, which would be close enough to trigger an automatic recount.\nOnly in North Carolina, among the battleground states, has Mr. Romney had a reasonably consistent polling edge over the final week of the campaign.\nIf the national popular vote winds up roughly tied, instead of favoring Mr. Obama by two points or so, then Mr. Romney could claw back to win Florida, Colorado and Virginia, and perhaps Iowa and New Hampshire. But Mr. Obama’s lead in Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada and Pennsylvania is clear enough to withstand some underperformance in the polls, and his margins in the polling averages there have converted into a victory on election night a very high percentage of the time historically.\nIn order for Mr. Romney to win the Electoral College, a large number of polls, across these states and others, would have to be in error, perhaps because they overestimated Democratic turnout. It’s this possibility, more than the chance of a successful hail-mary in a state like Pennsylvania, that accounts for most of Mr. Romney’s remaining chances of winning the Electoral College.\nThere is also the chance that Mr. Obama could finish toward the higher end of the polling range in most states. If Mr. Obama has gained a point or two nationally because of Hurricane Sandy or other factors, then polls taken before it may underestimate his standing in the individual states as well.\nThe FiveThirtyEight forecast accounts for this possibility through its trendline adjustment, which is why our forecasts now are slightly more optimistic for Mr. Obama in some states than a simple average of polls. Had there been evidence of late movement toward Mr. Romney, the trendline adjustment would instead have worked in his favor.\nBut Mr. Romney’s chances of winning the Electoral College have slipped, and are now only about 8 percent according to the forecast model — down from about 30 percent 10 days ago.\nThe most notable recent case of a candidate substantially beating his polls on Election Day came in 1980, when national surveys had Ronald Reagan only two or three points ahead of Jimmy Carter, and he won in a landslide instead. That year is not comparable to this one in many respects: the economy is much better now, there is not a major third-party candidate in the race, and Mr. Obama’s approval ratings are about 50 percent rather than 35 percent for Mr. Carter. And in 1980, Mr. Reagan had late momentum following the presidential debate that year, whereas this year the momentum seems to favor Mr. Obama.\nAll of this leaves Mr. Romney drawing to an inside straight. I hope you’ll excuse the cliché, but it’s appropriate here: in poker, making an inside straight requires you to catch one of 4 cards out of 48 remaining in the deck, the chances of which are about 8 percent. Those are now about Mr. Romney’s chances of winning the Electoral College, according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast.\nAs any poker player knows, those 8 percent chances do come up once in a while. If it happens this year, then a lot of polling firms will have to re-examine their assumptions — and we will have to re-examine ours about how trustworthy the polls are. But the odds are that Mr. Obama will win another term."},"100000001886298":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/obama-romney-presidential-election-2012.html","adx_keywords":"Presidential Election of 2012;Obama, Barack;Romney, Mitt;Voting and Voters;United States Politics and Government;United States","column":"","section":"U.S.","byline":"By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG","type":"Article","title":"Divided U.S. Gives Obama More Time","abstract":"Voters returned President Obama to the White House, but he will face a Congress with the same divisions that marked his first term.","published_date":"2012-11-07","source":"The New York Times","id":"100000001886298","asset_id":100000001886300,"views":1774237,"des_facet":["PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2012","VOTING AND VOTERS","UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"],"org_facet":"","per_facet":["OBAMA, BARACK","ROMNEY, MITT"],"geo_facet":["UNITED STATES"],"media":[{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"Americans voted to give President Obama a second chance to change Washington.","copyright":"Doug Mills/The New York Times","media-metadata":[{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/07elect2/07elect2-superJumbo.jpg","format":"superJumbo","height":1365,"width":2048},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/07elect2/07elect2-popup.jpg","format":"XLarge","height":433,"width":650},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/07elect2/07elect2-jumbo.jpg","format":"jumbo","height":683,"width":1024},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/07elect2/07elect2-articleInline.jpg","format":"Normal","height":127,"width":190},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/07elect2/07elect2-sfSpan.jpg","format":"Large","height":263,"width":395},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/07elect2/07elect2-hpMedium.jpg","format":"hpMedium","height":225,"width":337}]},{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"Americans voted to give President Obama a second chance to change Washington.","copyright":"Doug Mills/The New York Times","media-metadata":[{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-thumbWide.jpg","format":"Wide Thumbnail","height":126,"width":190},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-thumbStandard.jpg","format":"Standard Thumbnail","height":75,"width":75},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-superJumbo.jpg","format":"superJumbo","height":1218,"width":2048},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-hpLarge.jpg","format":"hpLarge","height":300,"width":511},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-articleLarge.jpg","format":"XLarge","height":330,"width":600},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-jumbo.jpg","format":"jumbo","height":609,"width":1024},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-thumbLarge.jpg","format":"thumbLarge","height":150,"width":150},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-slide.jpg","format":"slide","height":357,"width":600},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-sfSpan.jpg","format":"Large","height":250,"width":395},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/07/us/politics/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6/20121107_HP_OBAMA-slide-ZGN6-hpMedium.jpg","format":"hpMedium","height":200,"width":337}]},{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"President Obama, with his family, took the stage at McCormick Place in Chicago early Wednesday to speak at his victory party.

The victory was far narrower than his historic election four years ago, but it was no less dramatic.\n“Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back,” Mr. Obama told his supporters early Wednesday. “We know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come.”\nMr. Obama’s re-election extended his place in history, carrying the tenure of the nation’s first black president into a second term. His path followed a pattern that has been an arc to his political career: faltering when he seemed to be at his strongest — the period before his first debate with Mr. Romney — before he redoubled his efforts to lift himself and his supporters to victory.\nThe evening was not without the drama that has come to mark so many recent elections: For more than 90 minutes after the networks projected Mr. Obama as the winner, Mr. Romney held off calling him to concede. And as the president waited to declare victory in Chicago, Mr. Romney’s aides were prepared to head to the airport, suitcases packed, potentially to contest several close results.\nBut as it became increasingly clear that no amount of contesting would bring him victory, he called Mr. Obama to concede shortly before 1 a.m.\n“I wish all of them well, but particularly the president, the first lady and their daughters,” Mr. Romney told his supporters in Boston. “This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation.”\nHispanics made up an important part of Mr. Obama’s winning coalition, preliminary exit poll data showed. And before the night was through, there were already recriminations from Republican moderates who said Mr. Romney had gone too far during the primaries in his statements against those here illegally, including his promise that his get-tough policies would cause some to “self-deport.”\nMr. Obama, 51, faces governing in a deeply divided country and a partisan-rich capital, where Republicans retained their majority in the House and Democrats kept their control of the Senate. His re-election offers him a second chance that will quickly be tested, given the rapidly escalating fiscal showdown.\nFor Mr. Obama, the result brings a ratification of his sweeping health care act, which Mr. Romney had vowed to repeal. The law will now continue on course toward nearly full implementation in 2014, promising to change significantly the way medical services are administered nationwide.\nConfident that the economy is finally on a true path toward stability, Mr. Obama and his aides have hinted that he would seek to tackle some of the grand but unrealized promises of his first campaign, including the sort of immigration overhaul that has eluded presidents of both parties for decades.\nBut he will be venturing back into a Congressional environment similar to that of his first term, with the Senate under the control of Democrats and the House under the control of Republicans, whose leaders have hinted that they will be no less likely to challenge him than they were during the last four years."},"100000001887094":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/us/politics/state-by-state-battle-for-presidency-goes-to-voters.html","adx_keywords":"Presidential Election of 2012;Romney, Mitt;Obama, Barack;Voting and Voters","column":"Political Memo","section":"U.S.","byline":"By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY","type":"Article","title":"Clues Could Come Early in State-by-State Battle","abstract":"A guide to know who is up, who is down and if court challenges and recounts could be in the works.","published_date":"2012-11-06","source":"The New York Times","id":"100000001887094","asset_id":100000001887090,"views":272537,"des_facet":["PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2012"],"org_facet":"","per_facet":["ROMNEY, MITT","OBAMA, BARACK"],"geo_facet":"","media":[{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"<strong>IOWA </strong> Ray Benter, an Obama volunteer, canvassed on Monday in Des Moines.

It will finally know, as one of Mr. Obama’s top aides has put it, “which side is bluffing” and whether battleground-state polls, which have given Mr. Obama a slim but consistent edge where it matters most, accurately foretold the outcome. As the night unfolds, clues to the outcome will spill out well before the votes are counted.\nIf exit polling indicates that Mr. Romney is substantially exceeding the share of the white vote that went to Senator John McCain four years ago, that will be a sign that he is replicating the coalition that gave President George W. Bush a second term. If Mr. Obama can win Virginia, a battleground with an early poll-closing time, Mr. Romney’s options for getting an Electoral College majority will be substantially reduced. And in Ohio, the vote in Hamilton County, which Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush both won, could signal who takes the state.\nOn Monday, Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama went on traditional last-day blitzes across the most important swing states, overlapping in the place that is expected to have the lead role in Tuesday’s drama, Ohio.\nFor Mr. Obama, it was the last day of campaigning in a career that took him in a few short years from the Illinois State Senate to the United States Senate and, finally, the White House. For Mr. Romney, it was to be the end of his seven-year quest for the presidency. But late Monday, his aides announced that he would make one last pass at Pennsylvania and Ohio, with stops in Pittsburgh and Cleveland on Tuesday.\nSome Republicans said they believed the final push was needed given that Mr. Romney was going into Election Day without any of the top competitive states definitively in his column. A senior party strategist lamented that for all the optimistic signs, there was a preponderance of evidence “cutting against us.”\nDemocrats will be on high alert on Tuesday for what they consider attempts to suppress the vote, while Republicans make a case that strict voter identification rules and counting procedures be followed to guarantee the integrity of the outcome. Batteries of lawyers are standing by for both sides in the swing states, especially Ohio, where the skirmishing was already under way.\nThe rise of early voting across the country meant that even before Election Day, more than 30 million Americans had cast their ballots. Those results will be reported Tuesday night, providing a new element for viewers at home: many states will report initial results that encompass far more votes than ever before.\nNow, as the campaigns say, it is all about turnout. But beyond the cliché, the main question is not only how many but also who.\nMr. Romney’s campaign built its theory of winning around the idea that turnout for Mr. Obama will fall well below his 2008 tally. The Obama campaign did not entirely disagree, but believes it has rebuilt his coalition of women, Hispanics, blacks and young voters just enough to win.\nHere is a guide to what to look for as the night progresses to know who is up, who is down and whether, should there be delayed counts, recounts and court challenges, Election Day becomes Election Week or — gasp! — Month. (All times below are Eastern.)\nAt 7 p.m., when the voting ends in Virginia, an early clue to whether the night will be a long one or a short one may emerge. Both sides pursued the state’s 13 electoral votes tenaciously, but they are more central to the strategy of Mr. Romney, who made two stops there on Monday."},"100000001887116":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/opinion/the-real-loser-truth.html","adx_keywords":"Presidential Election of 2012;Political Advertising;United States Politics and Government;Presidents and Presidency (US);Romney, Mitt","column":"Op-Ed Contributor","section":"Opinion","byline":"By KEVIN M.

Not only is the line probably apocryphal, but also, this Election Day just might demonstrate that you really can fool all of the people — or at least enough of them — in the time it takes to win the White House.\nVenomous personal attacks and accusations of adultery, miscegenation and even bestiality are as old as the Republic. Aaron Burr was the sitting vice president when he killed Alexander Hamilton.\nBut while the line between fact and fiction in politics has always been fuzzy, a confluence of factors has strained our civic discourse, if it can still be called that, to the breaking point.\nThe economic boom and middle-class expansion of the postwar era encouraged relative deference for officials, journalists and scholars. It’s true that reporters and politicians had far cozier relationships, but the slower news cycle allowed more time for verification and analysis.\nCandidates accordingly believed that being caught in an outright lie could damage their careers. (As Daniel Patrick Moynihan reportedly said, “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.”) They tended only to bend the truth, not break it.\nIn 1948, President Harry S. Truman denounced Republican financiers as “bloodsuckers” and “gluttons of privilege,” but grounded his inflammatory language in the facts of Congress’s legislative record. He denied his “give ’em hell” reputation, saying later only that “I used to tell the truth on the Republicans, and they called it that.”\nTwo years later, Richard M. Nixon, running for the Senate from California, said his opponent, Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas, was “pink right down to her underwear,” a red-baiting remark, but one that referred to statements she’d made calling for global disarmament and civil rights for women and blacks.\nThe brass-knuckle 1964 campaign is remembered for Lyndon B. Johnson’s alarmist “daisy ad,” which suggested that Barry M. Goldwater’s election might lead to nuclear war. But it rested on statements Goldwater had made indicating a loose attitude toward nuclear weapons. (“Lob one into the men’s room in the Kremlin,” he once joked.)\nThe attack ads devised by the strategist Lee Atwater for Vice President George Bush in the 1988 campaign, one of the dirtiest ever, were grounded in at least a kernel of truth. Mr. Bush’s opponent, Michael S. Dukakis, might not have deserved blame for the furlough program that let Willie Horton commit additional crimes, but at least the program and prisoner were real. Atwater exploited these events, but did not invent them.\nAt least four factors since the 1970s have lowered the cost for politicians who lie and, more important, repeat their fabrications through their attack ads. First is the overall decline in respect for institutions and professionals of all kinds, from scientists and lawyers to journalists and civil servants.\nSecond are changes in media regulation and ownership. In 1985, the conservative organization Fairness in Media, backed by Senator Jesse Helms, tried to arrange a takeover of CBS and “become Dan Rather’s boss.” It failed, but two years later conservatives set the stage for an even bigger triumph. For decades, radio and television broadcasters had been required to present multiple viewpoints on contentious public debates on the grounds that they were stewards of the public airwaves. But in 1987, members appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the Federal Communications Commission abolished this “fairness doctrine.” The change facilitated the creation of conservative talk radio and cable outlets to combat perceived liberal bias. Liberals followed suit with programming (albeit less effective) of their own.\nAs this cacophony crescendoed, a third trend developed as political operatives realized they had more room to stretch the truth. In 2004, an aide to President George W. Bush dismissed a journalist for being part of a “reality-based community” of people who “believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.” But even Mr. Bush believed there were limits to truth-bending. The ads that attacked the military service of Senator John Kerry came from the ostensibly independent “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.” After the ads aired, Mr. Bush belatedly called them “bad for the system.”\nA fourth factor: most news organizations (with notable exceptions) abandoned their roles as political referees. Many resorted to an atrophied style that resembled stenography more than journalism, presenting all claims as equally valid. Fact checking, once a foundation for all reporting, was now deemed the province of a specialized few.\nBut as this campaign has made clear, not even the dedicated fact-checkers have made much difference.\nPolitiFact has chronicled 19 “pants on fire” lies by Mr. Romney and 7 by Mr. Obama since 2007, but Mr. Romney’s whoppers have been qualitatively far worse: the “apology tour,” the “government takeover of health care,” the “$4,000 tax hike on middle class families,” the gutting of welfare-to-work rules, the shipment by Chrysler of jobs from Ohio to China. Said one of his pollsters, Neil Newhouse, “We’re not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact checkers.”\nTo be sure, the Obama campaign has certainly had its own share of dissembling and distortion, including about Mr. Romney’s positions on abortion and foreign aid. But nothing in it — or in past campaigns, for that matter — has equaled the efforts of the Romney campaign in this realm. Its fundamental disdain for facts is something wholly new.\nThe voters, of course, may well recoil against these cynical manipulations at the polls. But win or lose, the Romney campaign has placed a big and historic bet on the proposition that facts can be ignored, more or less, with impunity."},"100000001889451":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/opinion/president-obamas-majority.html","adx_keywords":"Presidential Election of 2012;Obama, Barack;Romney, Mitt;United States Economy;United States Politics and Government;Voting and Voters;Editorials","column":"Editorial","section":"Opinion","byline":"","type":"Article","title":"President Obama’s Success","abstract":"A victory based on jobs, spreading the tax burden and rejecting the politics of deceit.","published_date":"2012-11-07","source":"The New York Times","id":"100000001889451","asset_id":100000001889450,"views":215945,"des_facet":["PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2012","UNITED STATES ECONOMY","VOTING AND VOTERS","EDITORIALS"],"org_facet":"","per_facet":["OBAMA, BARACK","ROMNEY, MITT"],"geo_facet":"","media":"","text":"President Obama’s dramatic re-election victory was not a sign that a fractured nation had finally come together on Election Day. But it was a strong endorsement of economic policies that stress job growth, health care reform, tax increases and balanced deficit reduction — and of moderate policies on immigration, abortion and same-sex marriage. It was a repudiation of Reagan-era bromides about tax-cutting and trickle-down economics, and of the politics of fear, intolerance and disinformation.\nThe president’s victory depended heavily on Midwestern Rust Belt states like Ohio, where the bailout of the auto industry — which Mr. Obama engineered and Mr. Romney opposed — proved widely popular for the simple reason that it worked.\nMore broadly, Midwestern voters seemed to endorse the president’s argument that the government has a significant role in creating private-sector jobs and boosting the economy. They rejected Mr. Romney’s position that Washington should simply stay out of such matters and let the free market work its will.\nThe Republicans’ last-ditch attempt to steal away Pennsylvania by stressing unemployment was a failure there and elsewhere. Voters who said unemployment was a major issue voted mainly for Mr. Obama.\nMr. Romney, it turns out, made a fatal decision during the primaries to endorse a hard line on immigration, which earned him a resounding rejection by Latinos. By adopting a callous position that illegal immigrants could be coerced into “self-deportation,” and by praising Arizona’s cruel immigration law, Mr. Romney made his road in Florida and several other crucial states much harder. Only one-third of voters said illegal immigrants should all be deported, while two-thirds endorsed some path to legal residency and citizenship. The Republican approach, if unchanged, will cost them dearly in the future.\n Still, Mr. Obama’s victory did not show a united country. Richer Americans supported Mr. Romney, while poorer Americans tended to vote for Mr. Obama. There also remained clear divisions among voters by gender, age, race and religion.\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama. White men voted for Mr. Romney; he won among those who said they opposed gay marriage, wanted to outlaw abortion, or favored mass deportation of illegal immigrants. None of those are majority positions in this country anymore.\nMr. Romney’s strategy of blaming Mr. Obama for just about everything, while serenely assuring Americans he had a plan to cut the deficit without raising taxes or making major cuts in Medicare, simply did not work.\nA solid majority of voters said President George W. Bush was to blame for the state of the economy rather than Mr. Obama. And voters showed more subtlety in their economic analysis than Mr. Romney probably expected. Those who thought the housing market and unemployment were the nation’s biggest problems said they voted for Mr. Obama. Those most concerned about taxes voted heavily for Mr. Romney.\nSignificantly, 60 percent of voters said taxes should be raised either on the rich or on everyone. Only 35 percent said they should not be raised at all; that group, naturally, went heavily for Mr. Romney. The polling made it clear that Americans were unhappy with the economic status quo, and substantial numbers of voters said the economy was getting worse. But Mr. Romney did not seem to persuade voters that the deficit was a crushing problem. Only 1 in 10 voters said the deficit was the most important issue facing the country.\nRepublicans had to be disappointed in the results of their unrelenting assault on Mr. Obama’s health care reform law. Only around a quarter of Americans said it should be repealed in its entirety.\nPeople who were comfortable with the rightward slide of the Republican Party (as measured by their comfort with the Tea Party) voted heavily for Mr. Romney.\nBut Christopher Murphy’s victory over Linda McMahon in the Senate race in Connecticut, Joe Donnelly’s defeat of Richard Mourdock in Indiana’s Senate race and Claire McCaskill’s defeat of Todd Akin in the Missouri Senate race showed the price the Republicans are paying for nominating fringe candidates in their primaries.\nThe polls were heartening in that they indicated that a solid majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal, and that half of Americans now say their states should recognize marriages between same-sex couples.\nThat the race came down to a relatively small number of voters in a relatively small number of states did not speak well for a national election apparatus that is so dependent on badly engineered and badly managed voting systems around the country. The delays and breakdowns in voting machines were inexcusable."},"100000001889511":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/senate-races.html","adx_keywords":"United States Politics and

snatched Republican Senate seats in Indiana and Massachusetts on Tuesday, averted what once were considered likely defeats in Missouri and Montana, and held control of the Senate, handing Republicans a string of stinging defeats for the second campaign season in a row.\nThe final balance of power depended on the results of tight races in Nevada and North Dakota, but it was clear that Democrats would maintain a majority and could even add to the 53 seats that they and their independent allies control. Senate leaders declared that their strong showing must be a signal to Republicans to come to the table to deal with the nation’s intractable problems, including the “fiscal cliff” facing Congress in January.\n“Now that the election is over, it’s time to put politics aside and work together to find solutions,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader. “The strategy of obstruction, gridlock and delay was soundly rejected by the American people. Now they are looking to us for solutions.”\nIn Indiana, Representative Joe Donnelly did what had seemed impossible by taking a Senate seat for the Democrats in a heavily Republican state, just weeks after his opponent, State Treasurer Richard Mourdock, said conception by rape was God’s will.\nIn Wisconsin, Representative Tammy Baldwin became the first openly gay candidate to secure a Senate seat with her defeat of former Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican.\nSenator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, a Democrat once considered the Senate’s most endangered incumbent, beat Representative Todd Akin, who seemingly sank his campaign when he said women who are victims of “legitimate rape” would not get pregnant.\nIn Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard professor, swept from power Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican whose surprise victory in January 2010 heralded the coming of the Tea Party wave. In Virginia, former Gov. Tim Kaine triumphed over another former governor, George Allen.\nDemocrats also scored a narrow victory in Montana, as Senator Jon Tester — one of the party’s most endangered incumbents — beat Representative Denny Rehberg, in what was believed to be the most expensive race in the state’s history.\nThose Democratic triumphs followed quick wins in Connecticut, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, all states where Republicans had harbored ambitions of victory that would propel them to a Senate majority for the first time since 2006.\nRepublicans lost another state when former Gov. Angus King Jr. of Maine, an independent, won his race to succeed Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a moderate who is retiring. Mr. King has yet to say which party he will caucus with next year, but he had warned Republicans and Democrats that his treatment during the campaign would bear on that decision. National Republicans and their “super PAC” allies responded by pummeling him with negative advertisements that did little to shake his lead.\n“We said we’d defend all of our seats and would put half of their seats in play,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who took that job last year when others had refused it.\n“No one believed me,” she said, “but we did just that.”\nThe Senate campaigns of 2012 will be remembered for the sudden salience of rape as a destructive political subject and a Democratic surge in a year once expected to be the party’s Waterloo. Two years after Tea Party-backed candidates in Colorado, Delaware and Nevada fumbled away Republican chances at Senate control, a new crop of conservatives appeared to do the same thing. That will surely raise new questions about the failure of Washington Republicans to control a right flank in their grass roots.\n“They’re going to have to decide whether they want to be in the majority or the minority,” Senator Snowe said. “It simply doesn’t make sense if Republicans decide they’re going to drive an ideological agenda as opposed to a practical agenda that is aligned with the principles of our roots.”\nRepresentative Christopher S. Murphy fended off the deep-pocketed campaign of the former wrestling executive Linda McMahon to win a Senate seat in Connecticut, and Senator Bill Nelson of Florida easily defeated his Republican challenger, Representative Connie Mack.\nSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio held off Josh Mandel, the Republican state treasurer, weathering an onslaught of negative advertising from outside groups to keep a seat for Democrats in a presidential battleground that Republicans were counting on.\nIn New York, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat, cruised to re-election. Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was also easily re-elected.\nThe results suggested that for the second consecutive election cycle, Republicans’ high hopes for a takeover of the Senate were dashed in large part by their own candidates. In 2010 and 2012, the disappointment could be laid at the feet of a very conservative Republican primary electorate that was determined to sweep out the party’s centrists."},"100000001887608":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/nyregion/cecilia-chang-ex-dean-of-st-johns-found-dead.html","adx_keywords":"Chang, Cecilia;St John's University;Suicides and Suicide Attempts;Colleges and Universities","column":"","section":"N.Y. / Region","byline":"By MOSI SECRET and WILLIAM K.

Fresh from Taiwan in 1975, she enrolled at St. John’s University as a student in Asian studies, becoming a dean in just five years and, soon after, winning the ear of the university’s top echelon as she raised more than $20 million for the school.\nBut the dean, Cecilia Chang, fought her way up driven by the same ambition and greed that would pull her down, accused of stealing more than $1 million from the school and using foreign scholarship students as her personal servants, prosecutors said during a three-week trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.\nHours after Dr. Chang took the stand in a desperate attempt to try to explain her actions, she was found dead in her multimillion-dollar home in Queens, one of the prizes of her swift ascent. Investigators said they believed she had committed suicide.\nDr. Chang’s lawyers had tried to reach her on Tuesday, and when they could not, they called her son and suggested he call the police. He did, and officers entered the home and discovered her body.\nThe beginning of the end came in 2010, when Dr. Chang was arrested and charged in the case. Prosecutors said she had used her position to recruit students to the school, promising them scholarships but threatening to expel them if they did not perform her household chores, including washing her underwear by hand.\nThey said she had created bank accounts in the students’ names, shuffling around tens of thousands of dollars that would ultimately end up in her pocket.\nThe government assembled a case so strong that Dr. Chang’s lawyers could hardly offer a defense in opening statements. She had taken the money, her lawyer said, but it was owed to her. The students had performed her chores, but not under duress.\nProsecutors called students and university officials to the stand, and they piled mounds of incriminating evidence atop Dr. Chang. She took the stand in her own defense, against the advice of her lawyers, providing the only defense evidence offered before her death. The presiding judge in the case, Sterling Johnson Jr., declared a mistrial after her death was confirmed.\nThe case was a reminder that trials are often where human dramas play out writ small. A courtroom tends to be an orderly, civilized place where jurors hear testimony about things that happened in the past. But beyond the metal detectors and the security guards, life can be much more grisly.\nDr. Chang’s defense lawyers released a statement on Tuesday. “Cecilia Chang dedicated 30 years of her life to St. John’s University,” it said. “She was a prolific fund-raiser and tireless advocate for her beloved Asian Studies Program at the University. Her death today is a sad ending to a complex human drama.”\nDominic Scianna, a spokesman for the university, said: “St. John’s University was saddened to learn this morning of the death of Cecilia Chang. We ask the entire St. John’s community to pray for her and her family.”\nSeparately, Judge Johnson, known for filling his sixth floor courtroom with levity, did not scale back when the news turned grim.\n“Sayonara,” Judge Johnson said, adding that Dr. Chang had gotten everything off her chest in the previous day’s testimony. “We never know how an individual handles the pressure.” He called the turn of events a “Shakespearean tragedy.”\nAt one point, the prosecutors hugged each other and the investigators in the case.\nAs the drama unfolded in the courtroom, Dr. Chang’s son, Steven, the subject of much courtroom testimony about the chores his mother’s students had performed for him, was outside of his mother’s house, prevented from entering by the police.\nThe court was waiting to hear from the police about whether the son had seen the body. The judge was satisfied that she had killed herself after the police said they had shown a photo of Dr. Chang to a neighbor, who said it was her.\nThe judge did not immediately inform the jurors of what happened, keeping them in a separate room until the death was confirmed. In private, he told them, “Dr. Chang is no longer with us,” according to several jurors who were present at the conversation.\nAll said the news came as a surprise.\n“My first thought was that she fled the country,” said a juror from Nassau County who did not want to give his full name.\n“We’re shocked,” said Joan Bophy, a juror from Staten Island. “And it’s a shame. She probably punished herself more than anybody would.”\nSome said she did not look right and thought it strange that she had seemed to implicate herself in her testimony.\n“You could see she was stressed, really stressed,” Ms. Bophy said. “She was digging herself a deeper hole.”\nSome learned for the first time about an article in The Daily News on Monday reporting that Dr. Chang was a suspect in her husband’s murder more than 20 years ago.\nA person with knowledge of that case said that after they were divorced, Dr. Chang’s husband was shot and lived for 10 days before dying. He told investigators before he died that he recognized the person who shot him, and said his wife must have paid the person to do it.\nDetectives were unable to corroborate his statement, which alone was not sufficient to support a case, and she was thus never charged. Dr. Chang saw the report before she testified."},"100000001886767":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/opinion/brooks-the-heart-grows-smarter.html","adx_keywords":"Emotions;Children and Childhood;Parenting;Men and Boys;Sociology;Psychology and Psychologists;Age, Chronological","column":"Op-Ed Columnist","section":"Opinion","byline":"By DAVID BROOKS","type":"Article","title":"The Heart Grows Smarter","abstract":"A study that has followed a set of men from 1938 to the present time confirms that emotional intelligence is critical to leading a contented life.","published_date":"2012-11-06","source":"The New York Times","id":"100000001886767","asset_id":100000001886770,"views":169314,"des_facet":["EMOTIONS","CHILDREN AND CHILDHOOD","SOCIOLOGY","PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGISTS","AGE, CHRONOLOGICAL"],"org_facet":"","per_facet":"","geo_facet":"","media":[{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"David Brooks","copyright":"Josh Haner/The New York Times","media-metadata":[{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Brooks_New/Brooks_New-thumbStandard.jpg","format":"Standard Thumbnail","height":75,"width":75},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Brooks_New/Brooks_New-jumbo-v2.jpg","format":"jumbo","height":500,"width":350},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Brooks_New/Brooks_New-articleInline.jpg","format":"Normal","height":240,"width":190}]},{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"David Brooks","copyright":"Josh Haner/The New York Times","media-metadata":[{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Brooks_New/Brooks_New-thumbStandard.jpg","format":"Standard Thumbnail","height":75,"width":75},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Brooks_New/Brooks_New-articleInline.jpg","format":"Normal","height":240,"width":190},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Brooks_New/Brooks_New-jumbo-v2.jpg","format":"jumbo","height":500,"width":350}]}],"text":"If you go back and read a bunch of biographies of people born 100 to 150 years ago, you notice a few things that were more common then than now.\nFirst, many more families suffered the loss of a child, which had a devastating and historically underappreciated impact on their overall worldviews.\nSecond, and maybe related, many more children grew up in cold and emotionally distant homes, where fathers, in particular, barely knew their children and found it impossible to express their love for them.\nIt wasn’t only parents who were emotionally diffident; it was the people who studied them. In 1938, a group of researchers began an intensive study of 268 students at Harvard University. The plan was to track them through their entire lives, measuring, testing and interviewing them every few years to see how lives develop.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, the researchers didn’t pay much attention to the men’s relationships. Instead, following the intellectual fashions of the day, they paid a lot of attention to the men’s physiognomy. Did they have a “masculine” body type? Did they show signs of vigorous genetic endowments?\nBut as this study — the Grant Study — progressed, the power of relationships became clear. The men who grew up in homes with warm parents were much more likely to become first lieutenants and majors in World War II. The men who grew up in cold, barren homes were much more likely to finish the war as privates.\nBody type was useless as a predictor of how the men would fare in life. So was birth order or political affiliation. Even social class had a limited effect. But having a warm childhood was powerful. As George Vaillant, the study director, sums it up in “Triumphs of Experience,” his most recent summary of the research, “It was the capacity for intimate relationships that predicted flourishing in all aspects of these men’s lives.”\nOf the 31 men in the study incapable of establishing intimate bonds, only four are still alive. Of those who were better at forming relationships, more than a third are living.\nIt’s not that the men who flourished had perfect childhoods. Rather, as Vaillant puts it, “What goes right is more important than what goes wrong.” The positive effect of one loving relative, mentor or friend can overwhelm the negative effects of the bad things that happen.\nIn case after case, the magic formula is capacity for intimacy combined with persistence, discipline, order and dependability. The men who could be affectionate about people and organized about things had very enjoyable lives.\nBut a childhood does not totally determine a life. The beauty of the Grant Study is that, as Vaillant emphasizes, it has followed its subjects for nine decades. The big finding is that you can teach an old dog new tricks. The men kept changing all the way through, even in their 80s and 90s.\nOne man in the study paid his way through Harvard by working as a psychiatric attendant. He slept from 6 p.m. to midnight. Worked the night shift at a hospital, then biked to class by 8 in the morning. After college, he tried his hand at theater. He did not succeed, and, at age 40, he saw himself as “mediocre and without imagination.” His middle years were professionally and maritally unhappy.\nBut, as he got older, he became less emotionally inhibited. In old age, he became a successful actor, playing roles like King Lear. He got married at 78. By 86, the only medicine he was taking was Viagra. He lived to 96.\nAnother subject grew up feeling that he “didn’t know either parent very well.” At 19, he wrote, “I don’t find it easy to make friends.” At 39, he wrote, “I feel lonely, rootless and disoriented.” At 50, he had basically given up trying to socialize and was trapped in an unhappy marriage.\nBut, as he aged, he changed. He became the president of his nursing home. He had girlfriends after the death of his first wife and then remarried. He didn’t turn into a social butterfly, but life was better.\nThe men of the Grant Study frequently became more emotionally attuned as they aged, more adept at recognizing and expressing emotion. Part of the explanation is biological. People, especially men, become more aware of their emotions as they get older.\nPart of this is probably historical. Over the past half-century or so, American culture has become more attuned to the power of relationships. Masculinity has changed, at least a bit.\nThe so-called Flynn Effect describes the rise in measured I.Q. scores over the decades. Perhaps we could invent something called the Grant Effect, on the improvement of mass emotional intelligence over the decades. This gradual change might be one of the greatest contributors to progress and well-being that we’ve experienced in our lifetimes."},"100000001889749":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/opinion/friedman-hope-and-change-part-two.html","adx_keywords":"Presidential Election of 2012;Obama, Barack;Romney, Mitt;Republican Party;United States Economy;United States Politics and Government","column":"Op-Ed Columnist","section":"Opinion","byline":"By THOMAS L.

To this day, I find McConnell’s declaration appalling. Consider all the problems we have faced in this country over the last four years — from debt to adapting to globalization to unemployment to the challenges of climate change to terrorism — and then roll over that statement: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.”\nThat, in my view, is what made the difference. The G.O.P. lost an election that, given the state of the economy, it should have won because of an excess of McConnell-like cynicism, a shortage of new ideas and an abundance of really bad ideas — about immigration, about climate, about how jobs are created and about abortion and other social issues.\nIt seems that many Americans went to the polls without much enthusiasm for either candidate, but, nevertheless, with a clear idea of whom they preferred. The majority seemed to be saying to Obama: “You didn’t get it all right the first time, but we’re going to give you a second chance.” In a way, they voted for “hope and change” again. I don’t think it was so much a ratification of health care or “Race to the Top” or any other Obama initiative. It was more a vote on his character: “We think you’re trying. Now try even harder. Learn from your mistakes. Reach out to the other side, even if they slap away your hand, and focus like a laser on the economy, so those of us who voted for you today without much enthusiasm can feel good about this vote.”\nAnd that is why Obama’s victory is so devastating for the G.O.P. A country with nearly 8 percent unemployment preferred to give the president a second chance rather than Mitt Romney a first one. The Republican Party today needs to have a real heart-to-heart with itself.\nThe G.O.P. has lost two presidential elections in a row because it forced its candidate to run so far to the loony right to get through the primaries, dominated by its ultraconservative base, that he could not get close enough back to the center to carry the national election. It is not enough for Republicans to tell their Democratic colleagues in private — as some do — “I wish I could help you, but our base is crazy.” They need to have their own reformation. The center-right has got to have it out with the far-right, or it is going to be a minority party for a long time.\nMany in the next generation of America know climate change is real, and they want to see something done to mitigate it. Many in the next generation of America will be of Hispanic origin and insist on humane immigration reform that gives a practical legal pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The next generation is going to need immigration of high-I.Q. risk-takers from India, China and Latin America if the U.S. is going to remain at the cutting edge of the Information Technology revolution and be able to afford the government we want. Many in the next generation of America see gays and lesbians in their families, workplaces and Army barracks, and they don’t want to deny them the marriage rights held by others. The G.O.P. today is at war with too many in the next generation of America on all of these issues.\nAll that said, my prediction is that the biggest domestic issue in the next four years will be how we respond to changes in technology, globalization and markets that have, in a very short space of time, made the decent-wage, middle-skilled job — the backbone of the middle class — increasingly obsolete. The only decent-wage jobs will be high-skilled ones.\nThe answer to that challenge will require a new level of political imagination — a combination of educational reforms and unprecedented collaboration between business, schools, universities and government to change how workers are trained and empowered to keep learning. It will require tax reforms and immigration reforms. America today desperately needs a center-right G.O.P. that is offering merit-based, market-based approaches to all these issues — and a willingness to meet the other side halfway. The country is starved for practical, bipartisan cooperation, and it will reward politicians who deliver it and punish those who don’t.\nThe votes have been counted. President Obama now needs to get to work to justify the second chance the country has given him, and the Republicans need to get to work understanding why that happened."},"100000001889731":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/obama-second-term-has-immediate-challenges.html","adx_keywords":"Obama, Barack;United States Politics and Government;Presidential Election of 2012;United States Economy;United States","column":"News Analysis","section":"U.S.","byline":"By PETER BAKER","type":"Article","title":"Question for the Victor: How Far Do You Push?","abstract":"Few voters expect President Obama to seriously change Washington; most just want him to make it function.","published_date":"2012-11-07","source":"The New York Times","id":"100000001889731","asset_id":100000001889730,"views":124392,"des_facet":["UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT","UNITED STATES ECONOMY"],"org_facet":"","per_facet":["OBAMA, BARACK"],"geo_facet":["UNITED STATES"],"media":[{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"This time around, grand visions for the president have been replaced by the prospect of long negotiations on spending and taxes.","copyright":"Doug Mills/The New York Times","media-metadata":[{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-thumbStandard.jpg","format":"Standard Thumbnail","height":75,"width":75},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-superJumbo.jpg","format":"superJumbo","height":1365,"width":2048},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-articleLarge.jpg","format":"XLarge","height":330,"width":600},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-popup.jpg","format":"XLarge","height":433,"width":650},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-jumbo.jpg","format":"jumbo","height":683,"width":1024},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-thumbLarge.jpg","format":"thumbLarge","height":150,"width":150},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-articleInline.jpg","format":"Normal","height":127,"width":190},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-sfSpan.jpg","format":"Large","height":263,"width":395},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-hpMedium.jpg","format":"hpMedium","height":225,"width":337}]},{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"This time around, grand visions for the president have been replaced by the prospect of long negotiations on spending and taxes.","copyright":"Doug Mills/The New York Times","media-metadata":[{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-thumbStandard.jpg","format":"Standard Thumbnail","height":75,"width":75},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-hpMedium.jpg","format":"hpMedium","height":225,"width":337},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-articleInline.jpg","format":"Normal","height":127,"width":190},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-sfSpan.jpg","format":"Large","height":263,"width":395},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-articleLarge.jpg","format":"XLarge","height":330,"width":600},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-popup.jpg","format":"XLarge","height":433,"width":650},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-jumbo.jpg","format":"jumbo","height":683,"width":1024},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-superJumbo.jpg","format":"superJumbo","height":1365,"width":2048},{"url":"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/11/08/us/07assess/07assess-thumbLarge.jpg","format":"thumbLarge","height":150,"width":150}]}],"text":"For President Obama, now comes a second chance. An electorate that considers the country to be on the wrong track nonetheless agreed to renew his contract in hopes that the next four years will be better than the last.\nA weary but triumphant president took the stage in Chicago early Wednesday morning before a jubilant crowd, clearly relieved to have survived a challenge that threatened to end his storybook political career. While he was speaking of America, he could have been talking about himself when he told the audience: “We have picked ourselves up. We have fought our way back.”\nMr. Obama emerges from a scalding campaign and a four-year education in the realities of Washington a far different figure from the man sent to the White House in 2008. What faces him in this next stage of his journey are not overinflated expectations of partisan, racial and global healing, but granular negotiations over spending cuts and tax increases plus a looming showdown with Iran.\nFew if any expect him to seriously change Washington anymore; most voters just seemed to want him to make it function. His remarkable personal story and trailblazing role are just a vague backdrop at this point to a campaign that often seemed to lack a singular, overriding mission beyond stopping his challenger from taking the country in another direction.\nMore seasoned and scarred, less prone to grandiosity and perhaps even less idealistic, Mr. Obama returns for a second term with a Congress still at least partly controlled by an opposition party that will claim a mandate of its own. He will have to choose between conciliation and confrontation, or find a way to toggle back and forth between the two.\n“Will he be more pugnacious and more willing to swing for the fences on domestic issues, judicial appointments and so forth?” asked Christopher Edley Jr., a dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime Obama friend who has been disappointed at times. “You can react to a narrow victory by trimming your sails, or you can decide ‘What the hell, let’s sail into the storm and make sure this has meant something.’ “\nThe champagne bottles from victory celebrations in Chicago will barely be emptied before Mr. Obama has to begin answering that question. The coming end-of-the-year fiscal cliff prompted by trillions of dollars of automatic tax increases and spending cuts could force Mr. Obama to define priorities that will shape the rest of his presidency before he even puts his hand on the Bible to take the oath a second time.\nMr. Obama has expressed hope that “the fever may break” after the election and that the parties come together, a theory encouraged by allies like Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. “I’ve talked with colleagues in the Senate who for months have told me they’re very anxious to get beyond the gridlock and craziness,” Mr. Kerry said.\nIf that proves overly optimistic, allies said, then the president’s re-election puts him in a stronger position than in the past. “I actually think he’s holding a lot of cards coming off a win,” said John D. Podesta, who led Mr. Obama’s transition team four years ago. “He can’t be overturned by veto, so he can create a certain set of demands on Republicans that they’re going to have to deal with.”\nBut even as votes were coming in, Republicans were making clear that Mr. Obama will have to deal with them, too.\n“If he wins, he wins — but at the same time, voters will clearly vote for a Republican House,” said Representative Joe Wilson, a South Carolina Republican who shouted “You lie!” at Mr. Obama during a speech to Congress. “The consequence of that is our voters really anticipate and count on us holding firm.”\nIt may have been inevitable that Mr. Obama could not live up to the heavy mantle of hope and change he assumed in 2008 as the first African-American to be elected president. Inheriting an economy in crisis, he pushed through a sweeping stimulus package, the health care law and Wall Street regulatory measures, and he headed off another depression. But he failed to change the culture of Washington or bring unemployment down to healthy levels.\nBy 2010, amid a Tea Party revolt over rising national debt and expanding government, his party lost the House. He spent the last two years trying to hang onto the White House and preserve his accomplishments."},"100000001889745":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/after-loss-gop-faces-struggle-over-partys-direction.html","adx_keywords":"Republican Party;Voting and Voters;Presidential Election of 2012;United States Politics and Government;Romney, Mitt;United States","column":"","section":"U.S.","byline":"By CARL HULSE","type":"Article","title":"Republicans Face Struggle Over Party’s Direction","abstract":"The coming debate will be centered on whether the party should keep pursuing an antigovernment stance, or whether it should focus on a strategy that recognizes the demographic tide running strongly against it.","published_date":"2012-11-07","source":"The New York Times","id":"100000001889745","asset_id":100000001889740,"views":123700,"des_facet":["PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2012","UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"],"org_facet":["REPUBLICAN PARTY"],"per_facet":["ROMNEY, MITT"],"geo_facet":["UNITED STATES"],"media":[{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"Mitt Romney was joined last week by former Gov.

Ralph Reed, a veteran of the conservative movement, said that Mr. Romney’s loss would stir resentment among those who believe the party made a mistake in nominating a more centrist Republican who had to work to appeal to the party’s base.\n“There’s definitely a feeling that it would be better to nominate a conservative of long-standing conviction,” he said.\nAs a party, Republicans continue to depend heavily on older working-class white voters in rural and suburban America — a shrinking percentage of the overall electorate — while Democrats rack up huge majorities among urban voters including blacks, Hispanics and other minorities. Not to mention younger Americans who are inclined to get their political news from Comedy Central and will not necessarily become more conservative as they age. The disparity means that Democrats can get well under 50 percent of the white vote and still win the presidency, a split that is only going to widen in the future.\nAccording to exit polls, about 7 in 10 Hispanics said they were voting for Mr. Obama. Mr. Romney won the support of nearly 6 in 10 whites. In urban areas, white voters were split over the two candidates, but about 6 in 10 white voters in the suburbs went for Mr. Romney, as did nearly two-thirds in rural areas.  \nMr. Romney won a majority of voters 65 or older, while Mr. Obama was backed by 6 in 10 Americans under 30, and won a narrow majority of those under 44.\nEven as they absorbed Mr. Romney’s defeat, the party’s top elected officials, strategists and activists said they believed that Republicans had offered a persuasive message of economic opportunism and fiscal restraint. While the messenger may have been flawed, they argued, Republicans should not stray from that approach in a moment of panic.\n“The party has to continually ask ourselves, what do we represent?” said Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican seen as a top White House contender in 2016. “But we have to remain the movement on behalf of upward mobility, the party people identify with their hopes and dreams. People want to have a chance.”\nMatt Kibbe, the president of the Tea Party-aligned group FreedomWorks, acknowledged there would be a natural struggle for the identity of the party in the election’s aftermath. But he argued that in some respects the fight had already been waged and won by the energized grass-roots forces that have shaped the contours of Republican politics in recent elections.\n“You are going to see a continuation of the fight between the old guard and all of the new blood that has come in since 2010, but I don’t know how dramatic it is going to be,” he said. “It is getting to point where you can’t reach back and pull another establishment Republican from the queue like we have done with Romney.”"},"100000001890270":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/us/politics/obama-victory-causes-republican-soul-searching.html","adx_keywords":"Presidential Election of 2012;Republican Party","column":"","section":"U.S.","byline":"By MICHAEL COOPER","type":"Article","title":"G.O.P.

The Wednesday-morning quarterbacking began quickly.\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, captured the feelings of many Republicans when he said in a statement that “we have a period of reflection and recalibration ahead for the Republican Party.”\n“While some will want to blame one wing of the party over the other,” Mr. Cornyn said in a statement, “the reality is candidates from all corners of our G.O.P. lost tonight. Clearly we have work to do in the weeks and months ahead.”\nThere was no shortage of theories — sometimes contradictory — from inside and outside party in the first hours after the 2012 elections.\nSome analysts and Republican strategists argued that the party could not win while alienating the growing Hispanic vote with its tough stance on immigration, could no longer afford to nominate candidates who fired up its conservative and Tea Party wings but turned off the more moderate voters in general elections, and that it had to find ways to win more support from women and young voters. But some conservatives took the opposite view, arguing that Mitt Romney had been essentially too moderate, a candidate who had won the minds if not the hearts of the party’s base.\nBut a number of Republican strategists who have worked on recent presidential campaigns argued that demography is destiny, and that the party was falling out of step with a changing country.\nJohn Weaver, a Republican strategist who worked on the presidential campaigns of Senator John McCain and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., has long argued that the party’s reliance on the votes of older white men was putting it on a demographically unsustainable path.\n“We have a choice: we can become a shrinking regional party of middle-aged and older white men, or we can fight to become a national governing party,” Mr. Weaver said in an interview. “And to do the latter we have to fix our Hispanic problem as quickly as possible, we’ve got to accept science and start calling out these false equivalencies when they occur within our party about things that are just not true, and not tolerate the intolerant.”\nMatthew Dowd, who was a top adviser in the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush, said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the Republican Party had become a “'Mad Men’ party in a ‘Modern Family’ America.”\nAnd Mark McKinnon, another former strategist for President Bush and Mr. McCain, argued that the party “needs messages and policies that appeal to a broader audience.”\n“This election proved that trying to expand a shrinking base ain’t gonna cut it,” Mr. McKinnon said in an e-mail. “It’s time to put some compassion back in conservatism. The party needs more tolerance, more diversity and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class.”\nBut not everyone was urging the party to run to the center. “No doubt the media will insist that Republicans must change, must sprint to the center, must embrace social liberalism, must accept that America is destined to play a less dominant role in the world,” Fred Barnes wrote on the blog of The Weekly Standard. “All that is hogwash, which is why Republicans are likely to reject it. Their ideology is not a problem.”\n“But there is also a hole in the Republican electorate,” he continued. “There aren’t enough Hispanics. As long as two-thirds of the growing Hispanic voting bloc lines up with Democrats, it will be increasingly difficult (though hardly impossible) for Republicans to win national elections. When George W. Bush won a narrow re-election in 2004, he got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. If Romney had managed that, he would have come closer to winning. He might even have won.”\nAnd Erick Erickson made this plea at RedState.com: “Just please, G.O.P., PLEASE — in four years let’s not go with the ‘he’s the most electable’ argument. The most electable usually aren’t.”\nBut there were bright spots for the party. Aided by redistricting, Republicans kept their hold on the House, and Speaker John A. Boehner announced that he would be speaking Wednesday afternoon about the “fiscal cliff and the need for both parties to find common ground.”\nRepublicans extended their dominance in state government, picking up at least one governor’s seat Tuesday night and increasing the number of Republican governors to 30, the most there have been in more than a decade. Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said that the state-level gains Republicans made in “provides optimism for the future.”\nAnd of course, even two years in politics is a long time. Just after Mr. McCain lost the 2008 elections there was similar hand-wringing in the party. Two years later, Republicans made historic gains in the midterm elections."},"100000001889478":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/web-sites-and-networks-focus-on-claims-of-fraud-and-intimidation.html","adx_keywords":"Presidential Election of 2012;News and News Media;Voting and Voters;Voting Machines","column":"","section":"U.S.","byline":"By JEREMY W.

His colleagues at the Fox News decision desk had called Ohio for President Obama, a move he insisted just a few minutes earlier would be premature.\n“We’ve got to be careful about calling this when we have 991 votes separating the candidates,” he scolded them. “I’d be very cautious about intruding into this process.”\nSilence settled over the set.\n“That’s awkward,” Megyn Kelly said, trying to break the tension. She and the co-anchor Bret Baier then offered to broker something of a compromise. One of them would walk down the hall and interview the number crunchers on the decision desk about why they made their call.\nAnd so ensued the most bizarre on-air encounter of election night: a network anchor interrogating Arnon Mishkin, a member of the Fox News decision team and a respected voting analyst, forcing him and a colleague to defend their news judgment against Mr. Rove, one of the most powerful Republican fund-raisers and strategists.\nHowever odd, the exchange perfectly captured one of the persistent sources of strain between the media and Republicans throughout the presidential campaign. Ever skeptical of a media bias toward Democrats, conservatives complained repeatedly that polls this year were showing an erroneous and biased edge for Mr. Obama.\nAs Fox News’s own polling showed an advantage for Mr. Obama late in the campaign, commentators on the network questioned whether the news organization had its numbers right. (As midnight approached on Tuesday, Mr. Rove, who helped lead one of the most powerful “super PACs” aiding Republicans this year, did appear to soften his objections somewhat.)\nSome conservatives started trumpeting the efforts of polling aggregators like UnSkewedPolls.com, which purported to “debunk the media bias and shatter the false illusion being created by the mainstream media.” (The Web site employs a methodology that mainstream pollsters have said is not credible.)\nBy early Wednesday, UnSkewedPolls.com had posted no updates and still had a headline about “Big Election Day Romney Turnout.”\nFor much of the campaign, the story emanating from conservative commentators was one of mistrust. It was not only the polls that were untrustworthy. Those Labor Department numbers that showed a rosier economic picture in the final weeks of the election? The books were cooked by pro-Obama stooges, conservatives charged.\nSuspicion of the other side — by conservatives and liberals alike — was evident in media coverage as the minutes ticked away to Tuesday’s poll closings across the country.\nThe one conclusion people across the political spectrum seemed to agree on — even before there was a clear winner — was that the other side had cheated, lied or intimidated its way to victory.\nSpeaking on MSNBC, the former Vermont governor and Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean declared that the “only way” Mr. Obama could lose in Ohio “is if people are prevented from casting their ballots, either by voting machines that aren’t functioning right or other forms of harassment.”\nWeb sites with large liberal followings like Mother Jones, Slate and The Huffington Post highlighted a video that claimed to show a “Romney-loving“ voting machine in Pennsylvania that was converting Obama votes into votes for Mitt Romney.\nBut the cries were louder on the right.\nFox News Radio reported that a man in North Carolina claimed to observe a poll worker coaxing a woman to vote for Mr. Obama. And Fox News broadcast several segments about a mural of the president, complete with his campaign logo and the words “hope” and “change,” that greeted voters at a Philadelphia school, a possible violation of a law against campaign materials at polling sites.\nAfter Republicans went to court and won an order to have the mural covered, the network reported that the covering was insufficient. It failed to obscure the campaign logo and slogan.\nThe Daily Caller led its Web site on Tuesday with a story about a photo from the James O’Keefe group Project Veritas that discovered a poster of Mr. Obama, Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks just a few feet from where voters were casting ballots in Newark.\nThere were other scattered reports online of possible targeting of Republicans: the Michigan Republican Party claiming that a poll watcher in Detroit was threatened with a gun; a woman in Florida initially denied entrance to a polling site because she was wearing a T-shirt with “MIT” on it.\nThough some conservatives like Mr. Rove initially doubted the election’s outcome, by around 10 p.m. many in the media had turned pessimistic about Mr. Romney’s chances.\nJohn Ellis, who worked on the Fox News decision desk in 2000, was one of them. “Obama wins. Popular vote still unclear,” he wrote on Twitter at 9:54 p.m.\nShortly after 10, Nicolle Wallace, a Republican analyst on ABC, talked of “soul-searching” ahead for the GOP; Alex Castellanos, on CNN, talked as if he assumed Mr. Romney was going to lose. “This is going to be a repudiation of the Republican Party,” he said.\nAt 11:12 p.m., NBC became the first network to call the election for Mr. Obama, only 12 minutes after all the networks were able to call it for him in 2008."},"100000001890237":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/us/politics/in-california-voters-approve-ballot-measure-that-raises-taxesin-california-approve-voters-ballot-measure-that-raises-taxes.html","adx_keywords":"Income Tax;Marijuana;Referendums;States (US);Education (K-12);California;Washington (State)","column":"","section":"U.S.","byline":"By NORIMITSU ONISHI","type":"Article","title":"Californians Back Taxes to Avoid Education Cuts","abstract":"In other referendum votes, Colorado and Washington  legalized marijuana for recreational use.","published_date":"2012-11-08","source":"The New York Times","id":"100000001890237","asset_id":100000001890240,"views":96317,"des_facet":["REFERENDUMS","STATES (US)","EDUCATION (K-12)"],"org_facet":["BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC","BRK.A","NYSE","UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC","UPS","NYSE","WAL-MART STORES INC","WMT","NYSE"],"per_facet":"","geo_facet":["CALIFORNIA","WASHINGTON (STATE)"],"media":"","text":"SAN FRANCISCO — California voters decisively approved a ballot measure that will raise taxes by $6 billion annually over seven years, according to election results on Wednesday. Voters heeded the pleas of Gov. Jerry Brown, who said the new revenues were necessary to save the state’s public schools and balance the budget.\nThe vote — 54 percent to 46 percent, with 98 percent of precincts reporting Wednesday morning — brought an end to an acrimonious, $123 million battle between the governor and conservative opponents in and outside the state. It was a victory for Mr. Brown, who had staked his personal prestige on the initiative’s success and campaigned intensely for it.\nAcross the country, voters in 38 states considered more than 170 ballot measures on fiscal, political and social issues that, in many cases, resonated nationally.\nVoters in Colorado and Washington made their states the first to legalize marijuana for recreational use. In Oregon, a similar measure appeared headed for defeat.\nSupporters of Washington’s initiative said they hoped its passage would ultimately change federal law, which regards any possession or sale of marijuana as illegal.\n“By sending this message, we can hopefully have a collaborative conversation with the federal government, and that they can see that their policy can be done differently and that prohibition is not working,” said Tonia S. Winchester, outreach director for the campaign behind the measure, Yes on I-502.\nIn Maryland, voters endorsed a ballot measure allowing in-state tuition at public colleges for illegal immigrants. Massachusetts was considering whether to legalize physician-assisted suicide for people with terminal illnesses. Though most of the votes were counted, the result was too close to call.\nBut nowhere was the fight over ballot measures fiercer than in California, where spending on campaigning for and against 11 measures totaled nearly $370 million, according to MapLight, an organization that tracks campaign spending.\nUnder Mr. Brown’s tax initiative, income tax rates for those earning more than $250,000 annually would be raised for seven years, and a one-quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax would be put in place for four years. Without the new revenue, Mr. Brown said, California would need to cut $6 billion a year in spending, mostly from the state’s already battered education system — a threat that appeared to have persuaded some voters on Tuesday.\n“We need more funding for the schools,” said Omega Jules, 31, who lives in Oakland and works for United Parcel Service of America. “They keep taking money out of education, and that is where we need it most.”\nSupported by California teachers’ unions, Mr. Brown was tenacious in seeking support for the initiative, but he encountered fierce and sometimes unexpected opposition.\n“I know a lot of people had some doubts, had some questions, about ‘Can you really go to the people and ask them to vote for a tax?’ ” Mr. Brown, a Democrat, said in thanking supporters at a Sacramento hotel, The Associated Press reported.\n“A core reason that brought people together in support of Proposition 30 was a belief in our schools and our university and the capacity of the state government to make an investment that benefits all of us,” he said.\nLast month, an obscure Arizona group called Americans for Responsible Leadership donated $11 million, in part to defeat Proposition 30. Also, Molly Munger, a civil rights lawyer and the daughter of Warren E. Buffett’s partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Charles Munger, spent more than $44 million on a rival tax measure, Proposition 38, which was overwhelmingly defeated, with 72.4 percent.\nAbout $135 million was spent in the battle over Proposition 32, which would have outlawed political donations by labor unions. The measure was soundly defeated.\nAlso in California, voters considered an initiative to end the death penalty. With about 98 percent of precincts partly reporting, the measure seemed headed for defeat, with opposition of52.7 percent, the semiofficial state results showed early on Wednesday.\nSupporters, including law enforcement officials, argued that administering the death penalty was inefficient and that eliminating it would save the state money. And that argument appeared to have swayed some voters, even those who did not oppose the practice on moral grounds.\n“It would be one thing if they said they were going to kill a criminal and then did it the next day,” said Lamarr Standberry, an Oakland resident who voted to repeal the death penalty. “If you’re going to do it, then just do it already. Instead it takes forever and costs a lot.”\nVoters endorsed a measure that would make the state’s three-strikes law somewhat more lenient by imposing a life sentence only for a third felony conviction considered serious or violent, but they rebuffed another that would have made mandatory the labeling of genetically modified food.\nTwo crucial education measures put charter schools on state ballots. By a wide margin, Georgia voters approved an amendment to the State Constitution that will allow for the creation of a commission to authorize new charter schools, which are publicly financed but independently operated. The measure drew national attention and campaign contributions from Alice Walton, the daughter of Sam Walton, Walmart’s founder, and Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party organization founded by the billionaire Koch brothers.\nIn Washington, voters were asked to allow charters into the state for the first time. Similar measures had failed three times in the past 16 years.\nMichigan voters rejected all six proposals on the ballot, including one that would have expanded the powers of emergency administrators to take over financially troubled local governments, and the ability of governors to appoint them, as well as another proposal that would have made collective bargaining a right for employees in the public and private sectors."},"100000001889738":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/same-sex-marriage-voting-election.html","adx_keywords":"Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships;Maine;Voting and Voters;Homosexuality;Elections","column":"","section":"U.S.","byline":"By ERIK ECKHOLM","type":"Article","title":"In Maine and Maryland, Victories at the Ballot Box for Same-Sex Marriage","abstract":"Jubilant gay rights advocates called the results a historic turning point, a sign that public opinion is shifting in their direction.","published_date":"2012-11-07","source":"The New York Times","id":"100000001889738","asset_id":100000001889740,"views":93772,"des_facet":["SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, CIVIL UNIONS AND DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS","VOTING AND VOTERS","HOMOSEXUALITY"],"org_facet":"","per_facet":"","geo_facet":["MAINE"],"media":"","text":"Voters in Maine and Maryland approved same-sex marriage on an election night that jubilant gay rights advocates called a historic turning point, the first time that marriage for gay men and lesbians has been approved at the ballot box.\nWhile six states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage through court decisions or legislative decisions, voters had rejected it more than 30 times in a row.\nResults for the other two states voting on same-sex marriage, Minnesota and Washington, were still coming in late Tuesday, but rights groups said that the victories in two states and possibly more were an important sign that public opinion was shifting in their direction.\n“We have made history for marriage equality by winning our first victory at the ballot box,” said Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, which raised millions of dollars for the races in the four states.\nMatt McTighe, the campaign manager for Mainers United for Marriage, said, “A lot of families in Maine just became more stable and secure.”\nAt a victory party in Baltimore, supporters of Maryland’s referendum danced and cheered as balloons filled the air. “I’m so elated right now,” said Mary Bruce Leigh, 32. “This is the civil rights issue of our time, and we have succeeded in Maryland.”\nIn what appeared to be a close race in Minnesota, voters were asked to adopt a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to a man and a woman. While the state already has a law barring same-sex marriage, conservatives hoped to prevent a future Legislature or court decision from reversing it.\nIn Washington State, supporters of a referendum authorizing same-sex marriage appeared to have an edge in pre-election polls, but final results were not expected until later this week because ballots were still being mailed in as late as Tuesday.\nLaurie Carlsson, 33, stood on a freeway overpass with a sign urging drivers to honk for the referendum.\n“Seattleites do not use their horns — ever — but today they’re honking,” Ms. Carlsson said as a deafening roar erupted. “It’s making me giddy.”\nIt has been a constant theme of opponents of same-sex marriage that whenever it has been put before voters it has lost. In 30 states, voters have limited marriage to a man and a woman through constitutional amendments, and same-sex marriage has also been blocked in referendums like those in California in 2008 and Maine in 2009.\nThis year, the legislatures in Washington and Maryland approved same-sex marriage, but opponents gathered enough signatures to force referendums. In Maine, since their loss in 2009, gay rights advocates have been cultivating public opinion in one-on-one conversations, and this year sponsored their successful repeat election.\nIn the final week of the campaign, the opponents of marriage rights, mainly financed by the National Organization for Marriage and the Roman Catholic Church, mounted a barrage of advertising and telephone appeals in all four states, trying to convince undecided voters that “redefining marriage” would force schools to “teach gay marriage” and require businesses and churches to violate religious principles.\nRights groups have denounced those messages as misleading scare tactics and say they do not seek to redefine marriage but to end discrimination.\nFor many weeks, reflecting their more than threefold advantage in fund-raising nationwide, advocates of same-sex marriage have unleashed advertisements of their own in which community members say that gay and lesbian friends deserve the same chance to love and marry that others enjoy.\nPre-election polling in Washington State indicated that a slight majority of voters supported the referendum. “We have weathered their waves of attacks and not lost any ground,” said Zach Silk, the campaign manager of Washington United for Marriage, in an interview before the voting began.\nFrank Schubert, who managed the campaigns to ban same-sex marriage in all four states, disputed the notion that Tuesday’s ballots were a major turning point. “The votes are very close everywhere,” he said."},"100000001887863":{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/movies/tony-scotts-suicide-complicates-top-gun-3d-project.html","adx_keywords":"Movies;Three-Dimensional Devices and Effects;Scott, Tony;Top Gun (Movie);Suicides and Suicide Attempts;Paramount Pictures","column":"","section":"Movies","byline":"By MICHAEL CIEPLY","type":"Article","title":"Suicide Complicates ‘Top Gun’ Project","abstract":"The suicide of the movie director Tony Scott has left the makers of a 3-D version of his blockbuster, “Top Gun,” with a film they want to sell without appearing insensitive.","published_date":"2012-11-07","source":"The New York Times","id":"100000001887863","asset_id":100000001887860,"views":92988,"des_facet":["MOVIES","THREE-DIMENSIONAL DEVICES AND EFFECTS"],"org_facet":["PARAMOUNT PICTURES"],"per_facet":["SCOTT, TONY"],"geo_facet":"","media":[{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"Tom Cruise in &ldquo;Top Gun,&rdquo;

And Paramount and its partners are left with a 3-D film that might be perceived by moviegoers as a tribute to a director whose death remains a mystery to many friends and associates. It might also become a final box-office triumph — but only if the studio can reach the audience without seeming insensitive or exploitative.\nParamount spotted the enormous potential in the conversion of older films when it joined in the release this year of a 3-D version of “Titanic,” with help from the film’s director, James Cameron, and the Stereo D company. Though familiar from endless showings in theaters and home-video formats since its debut in 1997, “Titanic” in its 3-D format had about $342 million in ticket sales around the world, with a conversion cost of only about $18 million.\nThe response was driven partly by a powerful reception in China, where the film opened to $67 million in first-weekend business from a pool of 3-D capable screens that is still growing.\nWith its dizzying aerial action, motorcycle moments and those deeply rippled abs in the volleyball sequence, “Top Gun” — which had about $354 million in worldwide ticket sales, split evenly between domestic and international — seemed a natural candidate for conversion, especially with the potential for a sequel.\nLegend3D, which counts “Hugo” and “Alice in Wonderland” among its projects, undertook the work as part of an expansion aimed at strengthening ties with the major studios and extending the company’s reach in Asia and Europe.\nMr. Scott contributed and responded enthusiastically to the conversion in the weeks before his death, according to people who were briefed on the project but were not authorized to speak publicly because Paramount has not finalized a plan.\nRepresentatives of Paramount, Legend3D and Mr. Bruckheimer declined to discuss “Top Gun 3-D.” But people briefed on the studio’s deliberations said it was considering a release in February, perhaps beginning with a one-week exclusive showing on domestic Imax screens.\nThat would mimic a strategy used to revive “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” which took in about $3 million in ticket sales with a digitally remastered 2-D Imax version in September.\nAn Imax representative declined to discuss “Top Gun 3-D.”\nAt one point, according to those people, studio executives considered releasing “Top Gun 3-D” as early as this year in China and Russia, given the enormous appetite for 3-D and the continued popularity of Mr. Cruise in those countries. The new version was submitted to film censors in China, those people said, despite its distinctly American patriotic theme, which involves United States fighter pilots who ultimately defeat an unidentified enemy flying Soviet-era MIGs.\nBut the Chinese have been silent so far; without clearance from the censor, the film could not find a spot on this year’s schedule in China, where the number of foreign releases is tightly restricted.\nWhatever timeline the studio adopts, it will have to tread the line between the usual exuberant promotion of a film and sensitivity to the circumstances of its director’s death. For Hollywood, the intersection of movies and real-life tragedies has been a recurring theme this year. In the spring 20th Century Fox changed the name of “Neighborhood Watch” to “The Watch” amid a national debate about vigilantism after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, and in the summer Warner Brothers adjusted its advertising and publicity plans for “The Dark Knight Rises” after a gunman opened fire and killed 12 and wounded 58 others at an opening-night showing of that film in a Colorado theater.\nFor now at least a few of the questions surrounding Mr. Scott’s plunge from the Vincent Thomas Bridge here have begun to settle.\nIn late October the Los Angeles County coroner’s office released a brief statement that officially ruled Mr. Scott’s death a suicide, and noted that toxicology reports from an autopsy revealed a “therapeutic level” of mirtazapine, an antidepressant, and zopiclone, a sleep aid. A more detailed report is expected in the next week, the coroner’s office said.\nOnly days before jumping, Mr. Scott had been scouting locations with Mr. Cruise for the proposed “Top Gun” sequel, which he would have directed.\nAt the same time, Mr. Scott was among the producers of “Out of the Furnace,” an action drama being directed by Scott Cooper, the director of “Crazy Heart,” with Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck and others in starring roles.\nLike a number of Mr. Scott’s friends and associates, Mr. Cooper declined in recent weeks to discuss Mr. Scott’s death or his work on the film. He said that Ridley Scott, Mr. Scott’s brother who is also a producer of “Out of the Furnace,” had repeatedly asked him and others not to discuss Mr. Scott’s life or demise.\nThrough their spokesman Simon Halls, both Ridley Scott and Tony Scott’s widow, Donna Scott, declined requests to be interviewed about Mr. Scott’s death or his final work.\nApart from the possible return of “Top Gun” in its 3-D version, Mr. Scott’s last work as a director appears to have been a Diet Mountain Dew commercial. It featured the entrepreneur Mark Cuban in a role that had him offering to trade fame and fortune for a last drink of the soda in a convenience store.\n“Tony was amazing,” Mr. Cuban said in a recent e-mail of his experience with Mr. Scott in making the 30-second spot. “He was fun, vibrant and having a great time on the set.”\nMr. Cuban added, “It is still so shocking to me that he is gone.”"}}
